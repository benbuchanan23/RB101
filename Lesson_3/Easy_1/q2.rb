# Question 2
# Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

what is != and where should you use it?   #==> "not equal" 
put ! before something, like !user_name   #==> turn object into opposite of their boolean equivalent
put ! after something, like words.uniq!  
      #==> mutating version of said method, creates permanent change
put ? before something
      #==> ? : is the ternary operator for if...else
put ? after something                   ==> returns (true/false) 
put !! before something, like !!user_name  ==> turns object into boolean equivalent
