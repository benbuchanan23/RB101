#  Question 2    ##############################
#  Identify all of the code implementations that correctly meet the following set of requirements.

##  Given an array of strings representing integers, iterate through all of the items in the array. If the integer value of the string is odd add it to a new array of odd integer strings. Once iteration is complete the new array should contain all of the odd integer strings from the original array.

numbers = ['2', '3', '5', '7', '8', '11', '13', '15', '18']
odd_numbers = []

numbers.each do |number|
  odd_numbers << number if number.to_i.odd?
end

p odd_numbers
