#  Example 3
#  Let's mix it up a little bit and have you try taking apart an example on your own.

[[1, 2], [3, 4]].map do |arr|
  puts arr.first
  arr.first
end

# Map out a detailed breakdown for the above example using the same approach as the previous two examples. What do you think will be returned and what will be the side-effects? You shouldn't have to guess; there is a right answer and you have all the knowledge necessary to take it apart. Take your time and be careful. Check the solution below once you have done this on your own.
