#  Question 7
#  Examine closely the following code:

nested_array = [['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd'], ['e', 'f']].map do |sub_arr|
  sub_arr.map do |letter|
    letter.upcase
  end
end

p nested_array
#  Without running the code, identify the matching description.

#C: The return value of the String#upcase method is returned by the inner block to the inner call to Array#map; this adds the uppercase string to a new array in place of the lowercase version. This new array is returned by the outer block to the outer call to Array#map. This call to map also creates a new array, populated by the new inner arrays (containing the uppercase strings), which it then returns.
