#  Question 9
#  For the second part of the solution, extracting the data, the format that is required in each case is as follows:

all_orders =[
  {customer_id: 12, customer_name: 'Emma Lopez', total_order_value: 483.48},
  {customer_id: 32, customer_name: 'Michael Richards', total_order_value: 205.65},
  # rest of data
]

fulfilled_orders =[
  {customer_id: 12, customer_name: 'Emma Lopez', order_value: 425.48},
  {customer_id: 32, customer_name: 'Michael Richards', order_value: 120.00},
  # rest of data
]
# customer_orders = [
#   {
#     customer_id: 12,
#     customer_name: 'Emma Lopez',
#     orders: [
#       { order_fulfilled: true, order_value: 135.99 },
#       { order_fulfilled: true, order_value: 289.49 },
#       { order_fulfilled: false, order_value: 58.00 }
#     ]
#   },
#   {
#     customer_id: 32,
#     customer_name: 'Michael Richards',
#     orders: [
#       { order_fulfilled: true, order_value: 120.00 },
#       { order_fulfilled: false, order_value: 85.65 }
#     ]
#   },
#   # rest of data...
# ]
#  For the unfiltered totals, the team again comes up with four possible solutions. Select all those that correctly implement the requirements.

# ANSWER: 
# A, B, & C. These all implement the requirement correctly.
