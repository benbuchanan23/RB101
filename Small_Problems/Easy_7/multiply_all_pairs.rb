#  Multiply All Pairs
# Write a method that takes two Array arguments in which each Array contains a list of numbers, and returns a new Array that contains the product of every pair of numbers that can be formed between the elements of the two Arrays. The results should be sorted by increasing value.

# You may assume that neither argument is an empty Array.

def multiply_all_pairs(array1, array2)
  new_array = array1.product(array2).map do |element| 
  element.inject(:*)
 end
 p new_array.flatten.sort
end


# Examples:
p multiply_all_pairs([2, 4], [4, 3, 1, 2]) == [2, 4, 4, 6, 8, 8, 12, 16]
