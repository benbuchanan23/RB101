#  Swap Case
# Write a method that takes a string as an argument and returns a new string in which every uppercase letter is replaced by its lowercase version, and every lowercase letter by its uppercase version. All other characters should be unchanged.

# You may not use String#swapcase; write your own version of this method.

def swapcase(string)
  string.swapcase
end

def swapcase(string)
  array = string.chars.map do |char|
    if ('a'..'z').include?(char)
      char.upcase
    elsif ('A'..'Z').include?(char)
      char.downcase
    else
      char
    end
  end
  p array.join
end

# Example:
p swapcase('CamelCase') == 'cAMELcASE'
p swapcase('Tonight on XYZ-TV') == 'tONIGHT ON xyz-tv'
